Movie Review analysis using Python

This project is an analytical project on the movies reviews on several bases. 

This project is compiled in python language along with machine learning concepts that gave us several applicable tools in order to make our project effective.

This project includes several algorithms, graphs, tools and features that enhances the quality of the project. 

The main reason behind doing this project is to provide or show a mirror to the viewer that reflects all the desired things and attributes he/she wants to see in a movie.

I used anaconda 3.6 version to accomplish this project.
